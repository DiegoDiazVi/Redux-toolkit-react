# Redux Toolkit Learning Project

## About

This React project, built with TypeScript, is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Redux Toolkit. The project covers key concepts such as:

- **Redux**: Understanding the core principles of Redux and how it manages state in large-scale applications.
- **Store**: Setting up and configuring the Redux store to hold the application's state.
- **Middlewares**: Implementing custom and built-in middlewares to extend Redux capabilities.
- **Dispatch**: Dispatching actions to update the state within the Redux store.
- **Actions**: Creating and handling actions that describe changes in the application state.
- **State**: Managing and accessing the global state of the application.
- **Asynchronous Actions**: Handling asynchronous logic using Redux Thunk or other middleware.
- **RTK Query**: Simplifying data fetching and caching within the application using RTK Query.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Leveraging the power of Redux Toolkit to streamline the setup and development process.
- **Slices**: Creating and organizing slices of state for better modularity and scalability.

This section is concise but provides a solid theoretical foundation on Redux before moving on to practical implementations. Since the Reducer, which is the core of Redux, has already been covered, learning Redux at this stage should be more straightforward and intuitive.
